## PyBer_Analysis

# Overview & Purpose

The purpose and overview of the project is to utilize python to create a summary of the ride-sharing data by city type. With the compiled information, we should create visual images & graphs to visualize total weekly fares for city types. 
This would create apt visualization of the ride data for Pyber so they would be able to improve and develop the ride-sharing services and sum up the affordability for underserved neighborhoods. 

# Results

Below is the ride sharing summary on aggregation for Pyber riders.

Key Notes 
* Urban drivers are nearly x2.5 times more than Suburban areas, and nearly x15 when compared to Rural areas.
* There are many more drivers in Urban areas when compared to the other two areas.
* However, the average fare per driver is highest in the rural areas.
* Also, the average fare per ride is lowest in Urban areas.

Also shown on the graph image above, in general, urban cities have total fees, revenue, and customers when compared to the other two city types for ride-sharing services. 


# Summary

The average riding distance should be relatively shorter when comparing Urban vs Non-urban city types. There are already too many drivers in the Urban areas, where each drivers are not getting enough customers or rides. We also have to put into the factor whether these customers are traveling within the city types. (urban > urban, rural > rural) or if they are intercrossing the city types. 
Most likely, many urban cities have subway, bus, or even airline transportation, and many of the riders take ride-sharing services so they could travel to rural/suburban areas from the urban areas. I believe the CEO should increase the drivers in the urban areas, so there would be more drivers available for urban -> rural/suburban area trips. 
Also, many of the suburban or rural area people would most likely have a car, and would only use the ride sharing services when they are traveling long distance or overseas, so if CEO would like to make any move on the profit model, he/she should increase more drivers in the urban areas.
